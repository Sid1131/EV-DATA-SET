# Electric Vehicle 
Imagine a car powered by electricity instead of gasoline. That's an electric vehicle (EV)!  These vehicles use electric motors and can be charged in different ways: by plugging into an external power source or using a battery.  This battery can even be charged by the sun through solar panels, or by converting fuel like gasoline into electricity with a generator or fuel cell.

Electric vehicles aren't new. They were actually popular in the 1800s because they were quiet and easy to drive compared to the early gasoline cars.  However, gasoline engines became more common for cars and trucks in the 20th century due to limitations in battery technology.

Today, electric vehicles are making a comeback! This is because batteries are getting better, people are more concerned about the environment, and electric cars help reduce pollution.  Governments around the world are even offering discounts and other benefits to encourage people to buy EVs.

Here's the future outlook:

More electric vehicles on the road: Sales are expected to jump from a small share in 2016 to 30% by 2030, especially in developed countries.
Focus on bigger electric vehicles: Governments are working on making larger electric vehicles, like trucks, more common.
Two and three-wheeler EVs dominate: Currently, most electric vehicles are motorcycles and scooters, especially in developing countries.
